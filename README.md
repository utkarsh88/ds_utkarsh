Neither the sentiment nor the trader data contained any missing values.
The market sentiment data's timestamp column required specific handling to convert to datetime objects. The Timestamp IST column, formatted as 'DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM', was successfully converted to datetime and used for merging.
Merging the trader performance data and market sentiment data was successfully achieved by aligning the datasets based on the date extracted from the sentiment timestamp.
Analysis of trader performance (Closed PnL) by market sentiment classification revealed that trading during periods of "Extreme Greed" was associated with the highest average profitability ($13.82), while "Fear" sentiment showed the highest total profitability ($834,809.51).
Periods of "Neutral" sentiment were associated with the lowest average profitability ($6.62), and "Extreme Fear" with the lowest total profitability ($127,287.97).
Visualizations confirmed these findings, clearly showing the differences in mean and total 'Closed PnL' across the various market sentiment categories.
Insights or Next Steps
Traders appear to be most profitable, on average, during periods of extreme market optimism (Extreme Greed), and the highest overall profit was accumulated during periods of Fear. This suggests potential strategies could involve capitalizing on volatility during Fear or participating in upward trends during Extreme Greed.
Further analysis could investigate specific trading behaviors (e.g., long vs. short positions, trade size) within each sentiment category to understand what contributes to the observed profitability patterns.
